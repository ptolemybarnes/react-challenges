# 03: Listing Todos

**Goal**: Enumerate a list of Todos

```js
[
  {
    "text": "Water plants",
    "id": "81f39cca-2af3-11ea-978f-2e728ce88125"
  },
  {
    "text": "Take the dog for a walk",
    "id": "81f39f40-2af3-11ea-978f-2e728ce88125"
  },
  {
    "text": "Watch paint dry",
    "id": "81f3a09e-2af3-11ea-978f-2e728ce88125"
  }
]
```

1. Hardcode in the above list inside your App's render method at the top, assigning it off to a constant.
2. Map over the list of todos and display it as an unordered list (`<ul`>).
3. Check the developer console in your browser for errors. Fix the one that appears. You will need to use the id values.

## Learning Objectives:
- The importance of the 'key' prop.

## Bonus:
- What's the drawback of passing the index values rather than an ID as the key prop?
