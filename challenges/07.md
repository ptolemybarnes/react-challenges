# 07: Error boundaries

**Goal**: Create an error boundary around a todo entry.

1. [Read and understand](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) the purpose of en error boundary and what makes a component an error boundary.
2. Throw an error inside `<TodoEntry />` if the content of the entry is undefined.
3. Create a component, '<TodoEntryErrorBoundary />`, that implements the appropriate error boundary methods.
4. Have your error boundary render the `children` prop as its default behaviour.
5. Have your error boundary instead display a sensible error message if there is an error.
6. Wrap `<TodoEntry />` within the error boundary.
6. Modify `db.json` to create the conditions under which the error boundary is displayed.
7. Check that your error boundary works as expected (note: there is a difference in behaviour between development and production).
