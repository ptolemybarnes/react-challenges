# 05: Creating new todos.

**Goal**: Allow the user to add a new todo.

1. Add a text input field for accepting a new todo.
2. Add a submit button that, when clicked, calls `db.create()` passing the new todo. The db client inserts an ID for the new todo for you.
3. The UI does not update when a new todo is created =( How can this problem be solved?

## Learning Objectives:
- Submitting data.
- Rerendering in response to changes in a remote data source.
