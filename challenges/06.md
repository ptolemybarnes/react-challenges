# 06: Deleting a todo.

**Goal**: Allow the user to remove a todo from the list.

1. First let's refactor. Extract `<li>` and its contents to a new component, `<TodoEntry />`. What props should it take?
2. Pass a function to `<TodoEntry />` that, when called, deletes the associated todo entry. Deleting an entry can be done by calling `db.delete()`, passing the ID of the todo.

## Bonus
- In the network tab, throttle your connection to 'Slow 3G'. Quickly double-click a delete button. Pay attention to outgoing network requests. What happens? How could this problem be mitigated?

## Learning Objectives:
- Extracting a component.
- Dealing with annoying users.
