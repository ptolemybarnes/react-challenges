# 04: Loading Todos Asynchronously

**Goal**: Enumerate a list of Todos asynchronously.

1. Run `npm run json-server` to start a simple endpoint that serves a list of todos, accessible at `http://localhost:3001/todos`. Check the provided `db.json` to view the contents of the database.
2. A client to the database is provided: import the `db` module from `src/db.js`.
3. Inside `componentDidMount`, call `db.getAll()`. This returns a promise that resolves to an array of todo entries.
4. Set the todo entries in the state. Enumerate from the entries in the state rather than the hardcoded list.

## Further Discussion
- What are React's lifecycle methods? In what order are they called?

## Bonus
- Handle the case where the request returns non-200.

## Learning Objectives:
- The `componentDidMount` method.
- The lifecycle of a component.
