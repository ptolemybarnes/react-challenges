# 01: Creating a title

**Goal**: Add a title "My Todo List" to the application.

1. Create component, `Title`, that shows a heading 'My Todo App'.
2. Render a `<Title />` React element on the page.
3. Refactor: rather than having 'My Todo App' hardcoded in the `<Title />` component, have it take a prop, `text`, that sets the title's text. Pass 'My Todo App' to `<Title />` from the App component.

## Discussion:
- What is a React component and what is a React element?
- What happens if you directly reassign or mutate a prop (without using `setState`) after the page has already rendered?

## Learning Objectives:
- How to declare a component.
- How to render a component
- How to pass props.
- Props are immutable.
- Components vs Elements.
