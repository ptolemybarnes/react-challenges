# 02: Set the title

**Goal**: Allow the owner of the Todo List to be set by the user. Provide an input field by which the user can enter their name and see the title, e.g "Amy's Todo List".

1. Add an `<input>` field with type 'text' above the title.
2. Read the React [documentation about forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) and understand how you can use the input field to set a value in the state, `ownerName`. `ownerName` should reflect what the user has typed into the input field.
3. Pass `ownerName` into `<Title />` to display the relevant text.

## Discussion:
- You should now have 2 components: `App` and `Title`. Which component is pure and which is effectful?
- What happens when you directly mutate or reassign state (without using the `setState` API) *after the page has already rendered*? (tip: use `setTimeout` to simulate this).

## Bonus:
- How should the title look when no owner has been set yet? Account for this case.

## Learning Objectives:
- Setting a user-entered value in a component's state.
- Rendering a value from a component's state.
- Setting up the state object in the constructor.
- The difference between pure and effectful components.
- State is mutable, but only via the `setState` API.
