# React Workshop

- Write your code in `todo-starter/`
- Follow the `challenges/`
- Use the `todo-example/` as a reference.

## Who is this for?

This workshop is intended for developers who have had some exposure to React but haven't had a chance to go over the fundamentals, or reflect on 'the React Way' of developing front-end applications.

## How to facilitate?

This workshop is inspired by [challenge-based learning](https://www.challengebasedlearning.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CBL_Guide2016.pdf).
As such the facilitator's role is to:
  - Run the reference implementation in `todo-example/` so participants understand what they are making. Participants should not look at the code for the reference implementation.
  - Keep track of time. 1/2 a day is recommended for the whole workshop.
  - Highlight opportunities for discussion of important concepts.
  - Point participants in the direction of useful resources.
